## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a hard time creating my Card component. At first, my website wouldn't show anything when I tried to create a Card component. I had to fix it by changing the style rules to correctly use React JavaScript syntax. The other problem I ran into was trying to fix my Card element so they would show up correctly. I had to fix the style rules so they had the needed spaces for them to correspond to the correct className.
